                The first step is choosing a vehicle that suits your lifestyle
                and budget. To help you in this process we've incorporated
                several ways of searching for vehicles on our leasing pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our main search asks for your postcode so that we can show you
                dealers in your area first in your search results. If you're
                seeking a specific vehicle, you can also select the manufacturer
                and model.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, if you don't have a vehicle in mind our other search
                options include body style and budget. Bear in mind that when
                searching by budget, this will show prices on set terms and
                mileages, changes to any of these will affect the monthly
                rental.

          We don't allow brokers to advertise on our leasing pages (except for
          Tesla). Therefore, this step has been made easier for you as all the
          deals on our pages are advertised by franchised main dealerships.

          The term and mileage on your lease affect your monthly rental, so it
          is important to consider your requirements carefully before taking out
          your contract. You should estimate your mileage as accurately as
          possible to avoid excess-mileage charges at the end of your contract.
          However, if your mileage needs changed mid-contract, then we would
          suggest contacting the finance company.

          Once all the key decisions are made and the dealership has sent you a
          quote that you are happy with, you will be asked to complete a finance
          application. The form usually requests personal information, including
          your name, address and employment details. Occasionally, the finance
          company will request additional information to support your
          application, such as bank statements or proof of address.

          If your finance application is approved, the dealer will then order
          your car. Dealers may have different processes in place but usually
          they will request confirmation either in the form of an order or
          confirmation email asking whether you wish to proceed and place an
          order for your lease car.

          Delivery (unless otherwise stated) will be free to any address in
          mainland Britain, but deliveries to Northern Ireland are only to the
          nearest port. When your car is delivered it will normally be on a
          transporter or driven by a delivery company. We recommend that you do
          the following checks when your car arrives. Check for any damage,
          scratches, missing extras, your warranty and service book. If any of
          these are not as ordered, we recommend you decline the delivery and do
          not sign the delivery note. However, if it's a minor detail and you
          still wish to sign for the car then we recommend that no matter how
          minor it is, you make a note of it on the delivery note and inform the
          dealership. Check the mileage, if the car has been driven as a
          delivery method it may have several hundred miles on the odometer, and
          you need to note this on the delivery note so it does not come out of
          your agreed allowance.

          You need to ensure the car is maintained to an acceptable standard,
          which means adhering to the service schedule and keeping the car in a
          roadworthy condition. Please check the parameters in the handbook at
          the beginning of the contract hire agreement. Maintenance contracts
          are available should you wish to include the cost of maintaining the
          car in your monthly rental; please look into this at the point of
          quotation.

          If you wish to lease another car at the end of your current contract
          then you should start the process at least three months prior to the
          expiry date, so there's time for your new vehicle to arrive before
          your old one goes back. However, the current semi-conductor shortage
          is causing havoc with new-car build times, so you might be better
          starting the process five months in advance, at least for the time
          being. If you wish to extend your current lease car, then contact your
          finance company to discuss your options. When returning your current
          vehicle, we recommend you take detailed photographs of the vehicle
          prior to return.

          Q. I can no longer afford the payments? A. Contact the finance company
          immediately; do not leave it and miss payments because this will be
          detrimental to your credit rating. Most finance companies have
          departments that will help you choose the correct option to end your
          lease or arrange repayment plans. Q. I no longer wish to lease a car,
          what can I do to hand the car back? A. Most finance companies will
          allow you to return the car, but you'll need to pay a cancellation
          fee. In most cases this can be 50% of the remaining rentals, although
          this can vary depending on the finance company.
