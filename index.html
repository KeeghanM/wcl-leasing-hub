                  The first step is choosing a vehicle that suits your lifestyle
                  and budget. To help you in this process we've incorporated
                  several ways of searching for vehicles on our leasing pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our main search asks for your postcode so that we can show you
                  dealers in your area first in your search results. If you're
                  seeking a specific vehicle, you can also select the
                  manufacturer and model.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, if you don't have a vehicle in mind our other search
                  options include body style and budget. Bear in mind that when
                  searching by budget, this will show prices on set terms and
                  mileages, changes to any of these will affect the monthly
                  rental.
                </p>

                  We don't allow brokers to advertise on our leasing pages
                  (except for Tesla).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore, this step has been made easier for you as all the
                  deals on our pages are advertised by franchised main
                  dealerships.

                  bills for excessive wear and tear. Which option is better

                  The fee that you pay at the start of a lease deal is larger
                  than the subsequent monthly ones, so while some dealers offer
                  12-month lease deals, they’re an expensive option.

                  The biggest worry with car leasing is that you may suddenly
                  find that you can no longer meet the repayments. However,
                  mileage limits and wear and tear bills can also cause
                  problems, while taking out GAP or PPI insurance can mitigate
                  concerns.

                  Contract Hire (most commonly known as leasing) is a form of
                  finance and therefore you will be asked to complete a credit
                  application form. It funds the use of a vehicle, but you are
                  not buying that vehicle.

                  Personal contract hire is a long-term rental agreement that
                  may suit you if you do not wish to purchase a vehicle
                  outright. You make fixed monthly payments for an agreed
                  period, and when the contract ends you return the vehicle.

                  When you take out a leasing contract it is based on a fixed
                  mileage limit, and you will be charged a penalty if you exceed
                  that limit.

                  While most car leasing agreements don’t cover maintenance as
                  standard, many let you add an optional maintenance package for
                  peace of mind and ease of budgeting.
